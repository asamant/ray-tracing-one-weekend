# ray-tracing-one-weekend
My code for the [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html) tutorial. Most of the code is "as is" from the website but with slight code changes or refectoring where felt needed.

The general tutorial flow is followed, and the sequence in which the code was developed is preserved by prefixing files with index numbers. The corresponding `main()` functions are also named accordingly (eg. `main1()` for file 1_....cpp) - to treat one of those functions as the entry point, remove the number from the function name and compile. All development was performed using Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2017.
